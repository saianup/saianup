# Sai Anup D V â€“ Robotics Portfolio

## About Me
I am a final-year **Robotics & Automation** student with a strong focus on **robotics software, ROS 2, and machine vision**.  
I design and implement systems for **perception, control, and autonomy**, spanning simulation, hardware integration, and microcontroller-based robotics.

## Portfolio Projects

| Project | Highlights |
|---|---|
| **Self-Localization Robot** | EKF-based localization using micro-ROS on ESP32; tested in both simulation and hardware. |
| **Autonomous Mobile Robot (ROS 2)** | Robot spawned in Gazebo and RViz; integrated differential drive and LiDAR plugins; ROS 2 control framework with diff drive controller and joint state broadcaster. SLAM/Nav2 pending due to Gazebo segmentation faults. |
| **Interactive Voice & Vision Robot** | YOLOv8 + RealSense for 3D object detection; Whisper AI for speech recognition; manipulator design completed. |
| **Autonomous Rover (IRoC 2024)** | Rover motion control, YOLOv8 obstacle detection, RealSense depth mapping, and navigation stack in ROS 2. |
| **Autonomous Sewage Cleaning Robot** | YOLOv8-based sewage tank detection and ROS 2-controlled gripper actuation. |
| **Sens-O-ROS Workshop** | Hands-on training for ROS 2 concepts, TurtleBot simulations, SLAM, navigation, and micro-ROS integration for microcontrollers. |
